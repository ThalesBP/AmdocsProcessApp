This code was designed defining the classes as they are physically separated in the real world: Rover and Terrain. And some auxiliary variables to define Position and Orientation. This way is easier to manage this information trought each classes' funcions that set up and manage them. There are two main classes, the Navigation that reads the environment informations and set it up, and the Main class that reads the Environment and run the plan paths for each rover.

You can run the code by the IDE (I used Intellij) or throught the console running the main class (windows example: java Main) at folder "AmdocsProcessApp\out\production\AmdocsProcessApp". The results should show up at ending of executing.
